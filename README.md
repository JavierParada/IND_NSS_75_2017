## Stratification

Each district will be a stratum. Within each district of a State/UT, generally speaking, two basic strata will be formed: 

(i) rural stratum comprising of all rural areas of the district and 

(ii) urban stratum comprising of all the urban areas of the district. 

However, within the urban areas of a district, if there are one or more towns with population one million or more as per Census 2011, each of them will form a separate basic stratum and the remaining urban areas of the district will be considered as another basic stratum. 

(b) In the case of rural sectors of Nagaland another special stratum will be formed within the
State consisting of all the villages which are difficult to access.
